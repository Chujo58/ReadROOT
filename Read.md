* ~~Unable to work out the ROIs so we will have to stick with the current Results tab.~~
* Will try to work out the log mode at some point?
* Try to get the PSD vs Energy plot. (This worked in seperate file will add the function later) Do a plt embed into pg.
* ~Add a darkmode/lightmode button (with changing text? if possible)~
* ~~Order for the graphs buttons: energy hist, psd hist, time hist, tof hist, psdvse hist, mcs graph~~
* make psd hist, time hist and psdvse hist
* ~~ROI added, needs FWHM, FWTM, resolution then done.~~
* Time histogram -> what units and also what's the range? units ig well see if we can have an auto scale for the x range units or else we can just make it seconds and call it a day.
