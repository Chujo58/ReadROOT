To Code:
* [ ] Maybe add a function to calibrate the x scale (ADC bins to eV).
* [ ] In the `__init__.py`, add a function to choose the header files' location (for the C++ part). If the headers are not the good ones, C++ won't find them and we need the full path for it to work. Make it so that a selection (tkinter maybe) shows up to choose the files we want. 

PLOTS TO DO

* [X] ENERGY
* [X] PSD
* [X] TIME
* [ ] TOF - cpp
* [ ] PSD vs ENERGY
* [X] MCS
